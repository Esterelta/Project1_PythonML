# Cyber Attack Prediction with Machine Learning

This project involves training a machine learning model to predict the type of cyberattack based on input data. 
It includes a web application where users can input information and receive predictions for different attack types, such as DDoS, Intrusion, or Malware.

- Machine learning model using regression, clustering, and classification.
- Predicts cyberattack types based on user input.
- Interactive web application for real-time predictions.

The dataset contains features such as Source Port, Destination Port, Protocol, Packet Length, Traffic Type, Malware Indicators, Anomaly Scores, and Alerts/Warnings.

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- Web Application: Flask
- Dataset Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Esterelta/Project1_PythonML.git
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
   python app.py
   
- Open the web application in your browser.
- Enter the required input fields (e.g., Source Port, Destination Port).
- Click "Predict" to get the predicted attack type.
